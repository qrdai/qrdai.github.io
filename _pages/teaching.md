**Introduction to Computer Systems (DATA130025) - fall 2024**

- Teaching assistant for an undergrad-level course with [Prof. Jiaqing Liang](https://lsdefine.github.io/) at the School of Data Science, Fudan University.

- Prepared tutorials for linux basics, and took charge of two lab assignments related to operating systems: ShellLab and MallocLab. The lab materials were customized based on the project resources of [OSTEP](https://github.com/remzi-arpacidusseau/ostep-projects).

<summary><strong>As an NLP/ML researcher, why did I choose to be the TA for a system course?</strong></summary>

Personal opinion: with the advent of LLMs, system knowledge, especially on operating systems and parallel computing, is becoming increasingly important for NLP research. In-depth understanding of distributed training techniques and frameworks, such as Pytorch FSDP, DeepSpeed ZeRO, and Megatron-LM, can essentially help researchers estimate the costs of their training, and perform tailored optimization to improve time and memory efficiency. Therefore, this introductory course on computer systems plays a crucial role in building the foundation of system education for future NLP researchers. As a member of the TA group, my goal is not only to polish the delivery of traditional computer system knowledge, but also to prepare my students for the fascinating world of LLMs and MLSys.
